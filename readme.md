# Election Polling Analysis

This Python project is designed to fetch, process, and analyze presidential polling data, providing a comprehensive and nuanced assessment of the current electoral landscape. It consists of several main scripts:

- **`analysis.py`**: The core script responsible for data fetching, processing, and applying various weighting mechanisms to adjust poll results.
- **`states.py`**: A script that scrapes state-specific electoral data from both the [270 To Win](https://www.270towin.com/) website and [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/), enhancing the analysis with state-level insights.
- **`app.py`**: A Streamlit application that provides an interactive user interface for visualizing results and adjusting configuration parameters dynamically.
- **`config.py`**: A configuration file containing adjustable parameters that control the behavior of the analysis.

The project leverages data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/)'s publicly available CSV files for both [presidential polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv) and [favorability polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/favorability_polls.csv). By applying a series of weightings to adjust for various factors—such as poll quality, partisanship, sample population type, and state significance—the analysis aims to produce an adjusted polling metric that more accurately reflects the true state of the presidential race.

## Weighting Calculations

To adjust raw polling data and produce a more accurate reflection of the electoral landscape, the project applies several weighting mechanisms. Each weight addresses a specific factor that can influence the reliability or relevance of a poll.

### 1. Time Decay Weight

**Objective**: To prioritize recent polls over older ones, acknowledging that public opinion can change rapidly.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

The weight decreases exponentially with the age of the poll:

$$
W_{\text{time decay}} = e^{-\lambda t}
$$

- **\( t \)**: The age of the poll in fractional days.

  $$
  t = \frac{\text{Current Timestamp} - \text{Poll Timestamp}}{86400}
  $$

  - *Justification*: Using fractional days increases precision, especially for recent polls where hours can make a difference.

- **\( \lambda \)**: The decay constant, representing how quickly the weight decreases over time.

  $$
  \lambda = \frac{\ln(\text{DECAY\_RATE})}{\text{HALF\_LIFE\_DAYS}}
  $$

  - **Parameters**:
    - `DECAY_RATE`: The rate at which the weight decays over the half-life period (default is `1.0`, meaning no decay).
    - `HALF_LIFE_DAYS`: The half-life period in days (default is `14` days).

**Justification for Exponential Decay**:

- Exponential decay reflects the idea that the influence of a poll diminishes over time.
- The half-life parameter allows for control over how quickly this influence wanes.
- Exponential functions are continuous and smooth, providing a realistic decay model.

**Implementation**:

- Adjust the `DECAY_RATE` and `HALF_LIFE_DAYS` in `config.py` or via the Streamlit app to reflect the desired decay behavior.

### 2. Grade Weight

**Objective**: To adjust poll weights based on the historical accuracy and methodological quality of the polling organizations.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

The normalized grade weight is calculated as:

$$
W_{\text{grade}} = \frac{\text{Numeric Grade}}{\text{Max Numeric Grade}}
$$

- **Numeric Grade**: A numerical representation of the pollster's grade assigned by FiveThirtyEight.
- **Max Numeric Grade**: The highest numeric grade among all pollsters in the dataset.

**Justification**:

- Pollsters with higher grades have historically produced more accurate polls.
- Normalization ensures that grades are scaled between 0 and 1, allowing for consistent weighting across different datasets.

**Error Handling**:

- If `Max Numeric Grade` is zero (which could happen if grades are missing), a small value (`ZERO_CORRECTION = 0.0001`) is used to prevent division by zero.

**Implementation**:

- Ensure that the grades are properly converted to numeric values, handling any non-standard grades or missing values.

### 3. Transparency Weight

**Objective**: To reward polls that are transparent about their methodologies, which can be an indicator of reliability.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

$$
W_{\text{transparency}} = \frac{\text{Transparency Score}}{\text{Max Transparency Score}}
$$

- **Transparency Score**: A score provided by FiveThirtyEight that reflects the level of methodological disclosure by the pollster.
- **Max Transparency Score**: The highest transparency score among all polls in the dataset.

**Justification**:

- Transparency allows for better assessment of a poll's quality.
- Polls that disclose their methods fully are more trustworthy.

**Error Handling**:

- If `Max Transparency Score` is zero, `ZERO_CORRECTION` is used to prevent division by zero.

### 4. Sample Size Weight

**Objective**: To account for the reliability of polls based on the number of respondents.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

$$
W_{\text{sample size}} = \frac{\text{Sample Size} - \text{Min Sample Size}}{\text{Max Sample Size} - \text{Min Sample Size}}
$$

- **Sample Size**: The number of respondents in the poll.
- **Min Sample Size** and **Max Sample Size**: The minimum and maximum sample sizes across all polls.

**Justification**:

- Larger sample sizes generally lead to more accurate and reliable results due to reduced sampling error.
- Normalizing the sample size ensures that weights are proportionate across the range of sample sizes.

**Error Handling**:

- If `Max Sample Size - Min Sample Size` is zero, `ZERO_CORRECTION` is used.

### 5. Partisan Weight

**Objective**: To mitigate potential biases introduced by polls sponsored by partisan organizations.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

$$
W_{\text{partisan}} =
\begin{cases}
\text{PARTISAN\_WEIGHT}[True], & \text{if the poll is partisan} \\
\text{PARTISAN\_WEIGHT}[False], & \text{if the poll is non-partisan}
\end{cases}
$$

**Default Values in `config.py`**:

- `PARTISAN_WEIGHT = {True: 0.01, False: 1.0}`

**Justification**:

- Partisan polls may exhibit bias toward a particular candidate or party.
- Assigning a significantly lower weight to partisan polls reduces their impact on the overall analysis.

**Implementation**:

- The weight values can be adjusted in `config.py` or via the Streamlit app to reflect the desired level of influence from partisan polls.

### 6. Population Weight

**Objective**: To adjust poll weights based on the population type surveyed, reflecting the likelihood that respondents will vote.

**Population Types and Weights**:

| Population Type          | Weight                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Likely Voters (`lv`)     | `POPULATION_WEIGHTS['lv'] = 1.0`      |
| Registered Voters (`rv`) | `POPULATION_WEIGHTS['rv'] = 0.75`     |
| Voters (`v`)             | `POPULATION_WEIGHTS['v'] = 0.5`       |
| Adults (`a`)             | `POPULATION_WEIGHTS['a'] = 0.25`      |
| All Respondents (`all`)  | `POPULATION_WEIGHTS['all'] = 0.01`    |

**Justification**:

- **Likely Voters** are most representative of the actual electorate, so they receive the highest weight.
- **Registered Voters** are somewhat less predictive, as not all registered voters turn out.
- **Adults** and **All Respondents** include individuals who may not be eligible or likely to vote, so they receive lower weights.

**Implementation**:

- These weights can be adjusted to reflect changes in voter behavior or to conduct sensitivity analyses.

### 7. State Rank Weight

The **State Rank Weight** integrates the electoral significance, political leaning, and current forecasts of each state into the overall weighting of polls. This weight ensures that polls from states that are more influential in the electoral college, have competitive political landscapes, and are projected to have close races are given greater consideration in the analysis.

**Objective**: To calculate a weight for each poll based on the state's electoral importance, partisan classification, and current election forecasts, thereby prioritizing polls from significant and competitive states.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

The state rank for each state is calculated as a weighted sum of three components:

$$
\text{State Rank} = (\text{Pro Status Value} \times 0.4) + (\text{Normalized Electoral Votes} \times 0.3) + (\text{Forecast Weight} \times 0.3)
$$

Where:

- **Pro Status Value**: A numerical representation of the state's partisan lean, derived from the `pro_status` codes provided by 270 To Win.
- **Normalized Electoral Votes**: The state's electoral votes divided by the total electoral votes (538), representing the state's relative electoral significance.
- **Forecast Weight**: Based on FiveThirtyEight's forecast data, representing the closeness of the race in each state.

**Components Explanation**:

1. **Pro Status Value (40% of State Rank)**:
   - Derived from the state's political classification:
     - `T`: Toss-up state (0.8)
     - `D1`, `R1`: Tilts Democrat/Republican (0.6)
     - `D2`, `R2`: Leans Democrat/Republican (0.4)
     - `D3`, `R3`: Likely Democrat/Republican (0.2)
     - `D4`, `R4`: Safe Democrat/Republican (0.1)
   - **Justification**: Reflects the competitiveness of the state based on historical and current political leanings, with higher values for more competitive states.

2. **Normalized Electoral Votes (30% of State Rank)**:
   - Calculated as:
     $$
     \text{Normalized Electoral Votes} = \frac{\text{State's Electoral Votes}}{538}
     $$
   - **Justification**: Gives more weight to states with more electoral votes, reflecting their greater potential impact on the election outcome.

3. **Forecast Weight (30% of State Rank)**:
   - Calculated as:
     $$
     \text{Forecast Weight} = 1 - \left( \frac{|\text{Forecast Median}|}{100} \right)
     $$
     - **Forecast Median**: The median forecasted margin between the candidates from FiveThirtyEight's data.
   - **Justification**: Prioritizes states with closer races, as they are more likely to influence the election outcome.

**Implementation Details**:

- **Data Retrieval**:
  - The `states.py` script fetches:
    - `pro_status` codes and electoral votes from 270 To Win.
    - Forecast medians from FiveThirtyEight's forecast JSON data.
- **State Rank Calculation**:
  - Each state's rank is calculated using the weighted sum formula above.
  - The ranks are normalized and used as weights in the polling analysis.
- **Incorporation into Combined Weight**:
  - The State Rank Weight is included as one of the factors in the combined weight calculation (see [Combining Weights](#8-combining-weights)).
  - Its influence can be adjusted using the `STATE_RANK_MULTIPLIER` in `config.py`:
    ```python
    STATE_RANK_MULTIPLIER = 1.0  # Adjust to increase or decrease influence
    ```

**Considerations**:

- **Dynamic Political Landscape**:
  - The state's `pro_status` and forecast data are regularly updated to reflect the most current information.
- **Data Handling**:
  - If forecast data is missing for a state, a default value is used to prevent computational errors.
- **Weight Sensitivity**:
  - The weighting percentages (40%, 30%, 30%) can be adjusted to emphasize different components based on analytical needs.

**Example Calculation**:

Suppose we have a state with the following characteristics:

- **Pro Status**: `T` (Toss-up state), so `Pro Status Value = 0.8`
- **Electoral Votes**: 20, so `Normalized Electoral Votes = 20 / 538 ≈ 0.0372`
- **Forecast Median**: 2.5 (indicating a close race), so:
  $$
  \text{Forecast Weight} = 1 - \left( \frac{2.5}{100} \right) = 0.975
  $$

The State Rank would be:

$$
\text{State Rank} = (0.8 \times 0.4) + (0.0372 \times 0.3) + (0.975 \times 0.3) \\
= 0.32 + 0.01116 + 0.2925 \\
\approx 0.62366
$$

This high rank indicates that the state is both competitive and significant in terms of electoral votes and current forecasts.

### 8. Combining Weights

An essential step in the analysis is to aggregate the individual weights calculated from various factors into a single **Combined Weight** for each poll. This combined weight determines the overall influence each poll will have on the final polling metrics.

**Objective**: To combine individual weights into a single weight that reflects all factors influencing poll reliability and relevance.

**Methods of Combining Weights**:

1. **Multiplicative Combination** (when `HEAVY_WEIGHT = True`):

   $$
   W_{\text{combined}} = \prod_{k} \left( W_k \times \text{Multiplier}_k \right)
   $$

   - **Pros**:
     - Strongly penalizes polls weak in any single criterion.
     - Emphasizes high-quality polls.
   - **Cons**:
     - Can overly penalize polls with minor weaknesses.

2. **Additive Combination** (when `HEAVY_WEIGHT = False`):

   $$
   W_{\text{combined}} = \frac{\sum_{k} \left( W_k \times \text{Multiplier}_k \right)}{n}
   $$

   - **Pros**:
     - Balances the influence of each weight.
     - More forgiving of polls with mixed strengths and weaknesses.
   - **Cons**:
     - May allow lower-quality polls to have more influence than desired.

**Multipliers**:

Multipliers adjust the influence of each individual weight:

```python
TIME_DECAY_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 1.0
SAMPLE_SIZE_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 1.0
NORMALIZED_NUMERIC_GRADE_MULTIPLIER = 1.0
NORMALIZED_POLLSCORE_MULTIPLIER = 1.0
NORMALIZED_TRANSPARENCY_SCORE_MULTIPLIER = 1.0
POPULATION_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 1.0
PARTISAN_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 1.0
STATE_RANK_MULTIPLIER = 1.0
```

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Calculate Individual Weights**: Compute each weight as described in the previous sections.
2. **Apply Multipliers**: Multiply each weight by its corresponding multiplier.
3. **Combine Weights**: Use the chosen method (multiplicative or additive) to compute the combined weight.
4. **Normalize Combined Weights** (Optional): Ensure combined weights are on a consistent scale.

### 9. Calculating Polling Metrics

**Objective**: To compute an adjusted polling metric for each candidate by combining poll results with their respective combined weights.

**Methodology**:

1. **Data Filtering**: Select relevant polls for the candidates within the specified time frame.
2. **Percentage Handling**: Standardize percentage values to ensure consistency.
3. **Combined Weight Calculation**: Calculate the combined weight for each poll.
4. **Weighted Sum and Total Weights**:
   - **Weighted Sum**:
     $$
     \text{Weighted Sum}_c = \sum_{i \in c} W_{\text{combined}, i} \times \text{pct}_i
     $$
   - **Total Weight**:
     $$
     \text{Total Weight}_c = \sum_{i \in c} W_{\text{combined}, i}
     $$
5. **Weighted Average**:
   $$
   \text{Weighted Average}_c = \frac{\text{Weighted Sum}_c}{\text{Total Weight}_c}
   $$

**Margin of Error Calculation**:

- **Effective Sample Size**:
  $$
  n_{\text{effective}} = \sum_{i} W_{\text{combined}, i} \times n_i
  $$
- **Margin of Error**:
  $$
  \text{Margin of Error}_c = z \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n_{\text{effective}}}} \times 100\%
  $$

  - **\( p \)**: Proportion (Weighted Average divided by 100).
  - **\( z \)**: Z-score (default is 1.96 for 95% confidence).

### 10. Calculating Favorability Differential

**Objective**: To calculate a weighted favorability differential for each candidate, reflecting net public sentiment.

**Methodology**:

1. **Data Filtering**: Extract favorability polls relevant to the candidates.
2. **Normalization**: Standardize 'favorable' and 'unfavorable' percentages.
3. **Combined Weight Calculation**: Calculate weights relevant to favorability data.
4. **Weighted Favorability Differential**:
   $$
   \text{Favorability Differential}_c = \frac{\text{Weighted Favorable Sum}_c - \text{Weighted Unfavorable Sum}_c}{\text{Total Weight}_c}
   $$

### 11. Combining Polling Metrics and Favorability Differential

**Objective**: To produce a final adjusted result by blending the weighted polling metrics with the favorability differential.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

$$
\text{Combined Result}_c = (1 - \alpha) \times \text{Polling Metric}_c + \alpha \times \text{Favorability Differential}_c
$$

- **\( \alpha \)**: Favorability Weight (default is `0.15`).

**Implementation**:

- Adjust the `FAVORABILITY_WEIGHT` in `config.py` or via the Streamlit app.
- Compute the final result for each candidate using the formula above.

### 12. Out-of-Bag (OOB) Variance Calculation

**Objective**: To estimate the variance associated with the polling metrics using a Random Forest model.

**Methodology**:

- **Random Forest Model**: Utilize the `RandomForestRegressor` with `oob_score=True`.
- **OOB Variance**:
  $$
  \sigma_{\text{OOB}}^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i^{\text{OOB}} \right)^2
  $$
  - **\( y_i \)**: Actual value.
  - **\( \hat{y}_i^{\text{OOB}} \)**: OOB prediction.

**Justification**:

- The OOB error provides an unbiased estimate of the model's prediction error.
- Enhances the reliability of the analysis by quantifying uncertainty.
