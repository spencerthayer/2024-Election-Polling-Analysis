# Election Polling Analysis
This Python script is designed to fetch, process, and analyze presidential polling data. Using data from FiveThirtyEight's publicly available [CSV file](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv), it applies a series of weightings to adjust for various factors such as poll quality, partisanship, and sample population type.
## Data Acquisition
The script fetches polling data using the Python `Requests` library. The data is then loaded into a `Pandas` DataFrame for analysis. This approach ensures that the analysis is always up-to-date with the latest available data.
## Weighting Calculations
The script employs several mathematical principles to calculate the final weight of each poll. Below we will explore how these weights are derived and applied to the polling data to calculate the adjusted polls which should result in a nuanced analysis of polling data.
### 1. Time Weights
The weight of a poll decreases exponentially based on how long ago it was conducted, underpinning the principle that more recent polls are more reflective of the current state of public opinion.

$$ w(t) = e^{-\lambda \cdot t} $$

- $w(t)$: Weight of the poll at time $t$ days from the present.
- $\lambda$: Decay constant, calculated as $\lambda = \ln(\text{rate-of-decay}) / \text{half-life}$.
- $t$: Time in days between the poll's conduct date and the present day.

The half-life, $h$, represents the period over which the poll's weight is reduced by the rate-of-decay, $r$, reflecting the decreasing influence of older polls over time. Thus, $\lambda$ is given by:

$$ \lambda = \frac{\ln(\text{r})}{h} $$

To determine $t$ for each poll, the difference in days between the poll's conduct date and the current date is calculated. This adjustment ensures that the poll's weight is inversely proportional to its age, with more recent polls being given greater emphasis in the analysis.

$$ t = \text{Current Date} - \text{Poll Conduct Date} $$
### 2. Grade Weights Calculation
Polls are weighted based on the grade assigned to the polling organization, which reflects their historical accuracy and methodology quality. FiveThirtyEight categorizes these grades, and in our script, each grade is associated with a specific numerical weight. This numerical weight translates the qualitative assessment of a poll’s reliability into a quantitative factor that can be used in further calculations. The mapping from grades to numerical weights is as follows:

```
A+: 1.0, A: 0.9, A-: 0.8,A/B: 0.75, B+: 0.7; B: 0.6, B-: 0.5, B/C: 0.45, C+: 0.4, C: 0.3, C-: 0.2, C/D: 0.15, D+: 0.1, D: 0.05, D-: 0.025, `null`: 0.0125
```

Each grade is assigned a weight that diminishes as the grade decreases, with ‘A+’ polls being considered the most reliable (and thus given a weight of 1.0) and ‘D-’ polls being considered the least reliable (with a weight of 0.025). This numerical representation of grades allows for a standardized and objective approach to adjust the impact of each poll based on the credibility and track record of the polling organization.

The logic behind this grading system is straightforward: higher grades correspond to higher numerical weights, indicating a greater degree of reliability and historical accuracy. Each grade step down represents a decrease in reliability, and this is reflected in the proportional decrease in the numerical weight. The specific weights were chosen to reflect a balance between acknowledging the quality of higher-graded polls and still allowing lower-graded polls to contribute to the overall analysis, albeit to a much lesser extent.

For a poll with grade, its grade weight is directly fetched from this predefined mapping. This explicit numerical representation ensures that the weight calculation process is transparent and consistent across all polls analyzed.
### 3. Partisan Weight Adjustment
Partisan-sponsored polls may have a bias toward their sponsor. The script applies a correction factor to account for this bias:

- If a poll is partisan (true), a weight of $0.25$ is applied.
- If a poll is non-partisan (false), a weight of $1$ is applied.

This adjustment, $W_{partisan}$, is applied directly based on the poll's partisanship status.
### 4. Population Sample Weights
Different polls target different segments of the population (e.g., likely voters, registered voters). The reliability of these polls varies with the population segment, so weights are applied accordingly:

- Likely voters (lv): $1.0$
- Registered voters (rv): $\frac{2}{3}$
- All adults (a): $\frac{1}{3}$

This is formalized as $W_{population}(P)$ where $P$ stands for the population type of the poll.
### 5. Combining Weights
After calculating individual weights, the combined weight of a poll is given by:

$$ W_{combined} = (W_{grade} \times W_{partisan} \times W_{population})
\times {w(t)} $$

This formula incorporates the time decay weight and multiplies it against the polls grade, partisan, and population weights.
### 6. Normalization
The normalization process ensures that the sum of weights across all polls equals 1, allowing for a fair comparison and aggregation:

$$ W_{normalized,i} = \frac{W_{combined,i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} W_{combined,j}} $$

- $W_{normalized,i}$: Normalized weight of the $i$th poll.
- $W_{combined,i}$: Combined weight of the $i$th poll before normalization.
- $N$: Total number of polls considered.
- $j$: Is the index of each poll in the series of polls from 1 to $N$ where $N$ is the total number of polls.

### 7. Adjusted Poll Results Calculation

Finally, to calculate adjusted poll results, each poll's result is multiplied by its normalized weight. This yields a weighted average that accounts for the reliability and relevance of each poll.

$$ \text{Adjusted Result} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (W_{normalized,i} \times \text{Poll Result}_i) $$

This formula ensures that polls which are more recent, from higher-grade organizations, non-partisan, and targeting more reliable population samples have a greater influence on the adjusted result.
## State Polling Considerations
I am struggling to determine the best methodology for incorporating state-specific polls into a broader analysis. Currently state-specific polling is influencing the broader analysis with out weighting or normalization which is less than ideal.

Incorporating state-specific polls into a broader analysis requires a careful balance between representing the unique political landscape of each state and maintaining a coherent overall picture. The strategies below are my thoughts on how to manage the complexity and variability of state-specific data to produce more accurate and meaningful analyses.
### State vs. National Polls
Balancing the input of state-specific and national polls in analyses aimed at predicting outcomes in electoral systems, like the U.S. presidential election, requires nuanced strategies. National polls offer a broad overview of voter sentiment across the entire country, while state-specific polls provide detailed insights into the political landscape of individual states. The integration of these polls must carefully mitigate the potential skew introduced by state-specific biases to maintain a coherent and accurate overall analysis.
#### Weighting Based on Electoral Votes or Population

When incorporating state-specific polls into broader analyses, one crucial aspect is to adjust the influence of each state's polls based on its electoral or demographic significance. This can be achieved through normalization, ensuring that states with larger populations or more electoral votes do not overshadow those with fewer.

1. **Electoral Votes or Population Weight $W_{electoral}$**:

   The weight of each state's polls based on electoral votes or population is calculated as a proportion of the total, using the formula:

   $$ W_{electoral} = \frac{EV_{state}}{EV_{total}} $$

   - $EV_{state}$: The number of electoral votes or the population size of the state being considered. This figure represents the direct influence or importance of the state in the electoral process. For instance, a state with a large population or a significant number of electoral votes plays a crucial role in national elections and should be weighted accordingly.

   - $EV_{total}$: The sum of electoral votes or the total population size of all states considered in the analysis. This total provides the basis for calculating each state's proportional influence. By dividing the individual state's electoral votes or population by this total, we obtain a normalized weight that fairly represents the state's significance relative to the entire country.

This normalization process ensures that the analysis reflects the distribution of electoral power or population across the country, making it possible to integrate state-specific insights into a national context without disproportionate influence from more populous or electorally significant states.
##### Python Example

To put these concepts into practice, here's an example of how you might calculate and apply these normalized weights in Python, considering both electoral votes and population data:

```python
# Example dictionaries containing electoral votes and population sizes for states
electoral_votes = {'California': 55, 'Texas': 38, 'New York': 29}
population_sizes = {'California': 39538223, 'Texas': 29145505, 'New York': 20201249}

# Calculate total electoral votes and total population size
EV_total = sum(electoral_votes.values())
population_total = sum(population_sizes.values())

# Normalize electoral votes and population sizes
normalized_EV = {state: ev / EV_total for state, ev in electoral_votes.items()}
normalized_population = {state: pop / population_total for state, pop in population_sizes.items()}

print("Normalized Electoral Votes:", normalized_EV)
print("Normalized Population Sizes:", normalized_population)
```

This example demonstrates calculating normalized weights for states based on their electoral votes and population sizes. Such weights can then be integrated into broader analyses to balance the influence of state-specific and national polls, reflecting the nuanced landscape of voter sentiment and electoral significance across the United States.
#### Weights based on Demographics 
Adjusting for demographic factors involves considering the unique characteristics of each state's population that might influence voting behavior. These characteristics include age distribution, racial and ethnic composition, education levels, and economic status. The goal is to quantify these factors in a way that allows their impact to be integrated into the analysis.

To incorporate demographic factors into the weighting of state-specific polls, you can calculate a demographic score for each state based on key demographic indicators. This score reflects the potential influence of the state's demographic makeup on its voting behavior.

A composite demographic score $D$ can be calculated by aggregating scores assigned to various demographic indicators such as:

   - Age Distribution Score $A$
   - Racial and Ethnic Composition Score $R$
   - Education Level Score $E$
   - Economic Status Score $S$

These scores are based on data such as census figures, surveys, and other relevant studies that provide insight into the demographics of each state.

**Weight Adjustment Based on Demographic Factors**:

The weight adjustment for demographic factors $W_{demographic}$ can be expressed as a weighted sum of the scores for the individual demographic indicators:
   $$ W_{demographic} = \alpha A + \beta R + \gamma E + \delta S $$

   - $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$: These are coefficients that represent the relative importance or influence of each demographic factor on voting behavior. The values of these coefficients can be determined based on historical data analysis, expert opinions, or statistical modeling.

   The resulting $W_{demographic}$ provides a numerical value that adjusts the weight of each state's polls based on its demographic profile, allowing the analysis to account for demographic influences on electoral outcomes.
##### Python Example

To implement these adjustments, you first need to define the scores for each demographic factor and then calculate the weighted demographic score for each state:

```python
# Example data structure for state demographic scores
state_demographics = {
    'California': {'Age': 0.8, 'Race': 0.9, 'Education': 0.7, 'Economic': 0.6},
    'Texas': {'Age': 0.7, 'Race': 0.8, 'Education': 0.6, 'Economic': 0.7},
    'New York': {'Age': 0.9, 'Race': 0.7, 'Education': 0.8, 'Economic': 0.6}
}

# Coefficients for the relative importance of each demographic factor
coefficients = {'Age': 0.25, 'Race': 0.25, 'Education': 0.25, 'Economic': 0.25}

# Calculate weighted demographic scores for each state
W_demographic = {}
for state, demographics in state_demographics.items():
    W_demographic[state] = sum(coefficients[factor] * score for factor, score in demographics.items())

print("Weighted Demographic Scores:", W_demographic)
```

This Python example calculates a weighted demographic score for each state by aggregating the scores of individual demographic factors, each weighted by its relative importance. This approach allows demographic adjustments to be seamlessly integrated into the broader analysis, ensuring that the unique demographic landscape of each state is appropriately considered.
#### Historical Voting Trend Adjustments

Adjusting for historical voting trends involves accounting for each state's voting history, such as its tendency to vote for a particular political party in past elections. This historical perspective can provide valuable insights into potential voting behavior in future elections.

Each state is assigned a historical trend score based on its voting patterns in previous elections. This score could be derived from the margins of victory, frequency of swinging between parties, or consistency in voting for a specific party. The weight adjustment based on historical voting trends $W_{historical}$ takes into account the state's historical trend score relative to the average trend score across all states:
   $$ W_{historical} = 1 + \lambda(H - H_{avg}) $$

   - $W_{historical}$: Weight adjustment based on historical voting trends.
   - $\lambda$: A sensitivity factor that determines how much historical trends influence the weight. A higher $\lambda$ means historical trends will have a greater impact on the adjustment.
   - $H$: Historical trend score for the state.
   - $H_{avg}$: The average historical trend score across all states, serving as a baseline for comparison.

   This formula adjusts each state's weight by increasing or decreasing it based on how its historical voting behavior compares to the national average. States with a history of strongly favoring one party might see their weight adjusted to reflect the potential for continued patterned voting behavior.
##### Python Example

To apply these historical adjustments, you would first define the historical trend scores for each state and then calculate the adjustment for each based on the average trend score:

```python
# Example historical trend scores for states
historical_trends = {'California': 0.6, 'Texas': 0.4, 'New York': 0.7}

# Calculate average historical trend score
H_avg = sum(historical_trends.values()) / len(historical_trends)

# Sensitivity factor for historical trend adjustment
lambda_factor = 0.1

# Calculate historical adjustments for each state
W_historical = {state: 1 + lambda_factor * (trend - H_avg) for state, trend in historical_trends.items()}

print("Historical Adjustments:", W_historical)
```

This Python code calculates the historical adjustment for each state by comparing its historical trend score to the national average. The adjustment is then scaled by a sensitivity factor, $\lambda$, which controls the extent to which historical trends influence the overall weighting. This method ensures that the unique electoral history of each state is factored into the analysis, providing a more nuanced understanding of potential voting outcomes.
### Reflections on State Weighting and Next Steps

Crafting a robust methodology to integrate state-specific polling into broader analyses indeed presents complex challenges. While progress has been made, there's room for further refinement and collaboration. I invite the community to contribute through pull requests, offering insights or adjustments that could enhance the solution to effectively balance state polling within national contexts.

Currently, the blend of national data and a varied set of state-specific polls seems to mitigate extreme skewing based on state influence. Nonetheless, the quest for "fairness" in weighting—especially by prominent polling aggregators like FiveThirtyEight—highlights a persistent challenge: accurately representing states that might lean heavily towards one political party despite having fewer electoral votes or a smaller population.

> Should Montana and Idaho really have the same value as Pennsylvania? Of course not.

The opportunity lies in acknowledging and adjusting for these biases, ensuring that each state's unique political landscape is proportionately reflected in the analysis. The objective isn't to diminish the value of any state but to apply a thoughtful normalization process that respects historical tendencies, demographic shifts, and electoral significance. Determining the optimal approach to this normalization requires a blend of statistical rigor and innovative thinking. I'm keen to explore various methodologies and collaborate with the community to refine these adjustments, aiming to achieve a more balanced and representative analysis of state and national polling data.
